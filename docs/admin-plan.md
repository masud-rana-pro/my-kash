# SmartKash Admin Plan

## Scope

The MVP admin panel is minimal. It supports operational review and status actions only.

Do not add full dashboards, analytics, reports, advanced settings, or complex role management in MVP Phase 1.

Admin functionality remains backend-owned through Spring Boot routes/APIs. The Flutter cross-platform direction does not add admin business features in this step.

## Access Control

- Admin web routes and admin APIs require authenticated `ADMIN` role.
- Customers and merchants must not access admin pages or APIs.
- Admin actions should be written to `admin_audit_logs`.
- Step 16 creates the `admin_audit_logs` persistence foundation and internal service helper only. Admin audit list APIs and approval/rejection flow integration are future scope.
- Admin controllers must stay thin and delegate approval/rejection logic to services.
- Admin APIs must use request/response DTOs and must not expose entities directly.

## Admin Pages

- Users list
- Transactions list
- Add Money requests list
- Loan requests list
- Recharges list
- Payments list
- Audit logs list

## Admin API Routes

- `GET /admin/users`
- `GET /admin/transactions`
- `GET /admin/add-money/requests`
- `POST /admin/add-money/requests/{id}/approve`
- `POST /admin/add-money/requests/{id}/reject`
- `GET /admin/loans/requests`
- `POST /admin/loans/requests/{id}/approve`
- `POST /admin/loans/requests/{id}/reject`
- `GET /admin/recharges`
- `GET /admin/payments`
- `GET /admin/audit-logs`
