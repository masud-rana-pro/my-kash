# SmartKash Codex Progress

## Current Project

- Project name: SmartKash
- MVP type: zero-budget learning MVP
- Current branch: main

## Completed Steps

- Step 00 planning foundation: planning files, architecture rules, Bengali learning workflow, Git/GitHub workflow rules, and progress tracking file prepared.
- Step 00b learning documentation rules: strengthened the Bengali learning file requirements before Step 01.
- Step 01 project structure: created focused root folders for the future Flutter app, Spring Boot backend, helper scripts, and added a project `.gitignore`.
- Step 02 Flutter app skeleton: created the initial Flutter shell under `apps/mobile/` with Riverpod, go_router, base theme/config, feature-first folders, and a placeholder home screen.
- Step 03 Spring Boot backend skeleton: created the Maven/Java 21 Spring Boot backend shell under `services/backend/` with base dependencies, environment-based config placeholders, package markers, Maven Wrapper, and context-load test.
- Step 04 PostgreSQL and Flyway foundation: enabled local datasource/JPA/Flyway configuration through environment variables, added the empty Flyway migration folder, and documented Maven Wrapper verification against the local PostgreSQL database.
- Step 05 Firebase Auth foundation: added Flutter Firebase Core/Auth dependencies, opt-in Firebase initialization, auth service/provider structure, Android client config instructions, backend Firebase Admin environment-property foundation, and Firebase ID token verifier skeleton without login API/JWT/user creation.
- Step 06 backend auth JWT foundation: added `POST /api/auth/firebase-login`, Firebase token verification service flow, backend JWT generation/parsing, stateless Spring Security foundation, DTO validation, global API error responses, and JWT unit coverage without user/wallet/PIN/business persistence.
- Step 06b cross-platform planning and structure update: changed project direction from Flutter Android-first to Flutter full cross-platform, added/verified Android, iOS, Web, Windows, Linux, and macOS platform folders, preserved existing Flutter app structure and backend foundations, and documented platform limitations.
- Step 06c manual verification workflow: updated Codex workflow rules so heavy Flutter/backend build and test commands are not run automatically unless explicitly requested; Codex now commits/pushes focused changes and provides manual verification commands for the user.
- Step 07 user/profile database foundation: added Flyway migration for minimal `users` and `user_profiles` tables, JPA entities, repositories, role/status enums, response DTOs, mapper/service/controller foundation, and read-only `GET /api/users/me` without wallet, PIN, ledger, transaction, or money-changing features.
- Step 08 Firebase login user persistence: linked `POST /api/auth/firebase-login` to the persisted `users` table so valid Firebase tokens create or find a minimal user record and issue backend JWTs with the persisted role, without wallet, PIN, profile editing, or money-changing features.
- Step 09 user profile completion foundation: added authenticated `PUT /api/users/me/profile` to create or update minimal profile fields using the JWT/Firebase UID, without accepting user IDs or adding wallet, PIN, or money-changing features.
- Step 10 PIN setup foundation: added user PIN fields, BCrypt password encoder, authenticated `POST /api/auth/set-pin`, 5-digit PIN validation, backend-only hashing, and PIN setup response metadata without PIN verification, rate limiting, wallet, or money-changing features.
- Step 11 PIN verification foundation: added authenticated `POST /api/auth/verify-pin`, BCrypt PIN matching, failed attempt tracking, 15-minute temporary block after 5 wrong attempts, and UI sample-image workflow reminder without wallet or money-changing APIs.
- Step 12 wallet database foundation: added `wallets` table, wallet entity/repository/DTO/mapper/service/controller, optimistic version field, and read-only `GET /api/wallet/me` without wallet creation, balance mutation, ledger, transaction, or money-changing APIs.
- Step 13 ledger and transaction database foundation: added `transactions` and `ledger_entries` tables, enums, entities, and repositories for immutable ledger/user-facing transaction records without APIs, wallet balance changes, or money movement.
- Step 14 idempotency key database foundation: added `idempotency_keys` table, enums, entity, repository, and internal service helper foundation without controllers, public APIs, wallet balance mutation, or money-changing flows.
- Step 15 wallet creation lifecycle: linked Firebase login to backend wallet provisioning so authenticated users get one zero-balance `BDT` wallet when missing, without ledger entries, transaction records, wallet balance mutation APIs, or money-changing flows.
- Step 16 admin audit log foundation: added `admin_audit_logs` table, audit action/target enums, entity, repository, and internal service helper foundation without admin APIs or approval/rejection flow integration.
- Step 17 Add Money request foundation: added `add_money_requests` table, status/source enums, entity, repository, DTOs, mapper, service, and authenticated customer create/list APIs that save `PENDING` requests only without wallet credit, ledger entries, transaction records, idempotency records, FCM alerts, or admin approval flows.
- Step 18 merchant profile foundation: added `merchants` table, merchant status enum, entity, repository, DTOs, mapper, service, and authenticated current-user create/read APIs that promote the user role to `MERCHANT` without payment, wallet debit/credit, ledger entries, or transaction records.
- Step 19 Loan request foundation: added `loan_requests` table, loan status enum, entity, repository, DTOs, mapper, service, and authenticated customer create/list APIs that save `PENDING` requests only without approval/rejection, disbursement, wallet credit, repayment, installments, ledger entries, or transaction records.
- Step 20 Mobile recharge foundation: added `mobile_recharges` table, operator/status enums, entity, repository, DTOs, mapper, service, and authenticated customer demo create/list APIs that save recharge records only without wallet debit, provider integration, ledger entries, transaction records, idempotency records, PIN confirmation, or FCM alerts.
- Step 21 Savings goal foundation: added `savings_goals` table, goal status enum, entity, repository, DTOs, mapper, service, and authenticated customer create/list APIs that save goal records only without savings deposits, wallet debit, ledger entries, transaction records, idempotency records, PIN confirmation, or FCM alerts.
- Step 22 Transaction history read API foundation: added authenticated read-only transaction list/detail APIs, response DTO, mapper, service, and filtered repository query without creating, updating, or deleting transactions, ledger entries, or wallet balances.
- Step 23 Admin read API foundation: added `ADMIN`-only security for `/admin/**`, read-only admin endpoints for users, transactions, add-money requests, loan requests, recharges, payments placeholder, and audit logs without approval/rejection, dashboard analytics, settings, role management, wallet mutation, or money-changing actions.
- Step 24 Add Money admin approval/rejection: added `ADMIN` approval/rejection endpoints with idempotency, locked request/wallet reads, wallet credit on approval, `ADD_MONEY` transaction record, immutable credit ledger entry, idempotency completion, and admin audit logs; rejection updates status/audit/idempotency only without wallet balance changes.
- Step 25 Loan admin approval/rejection: added `ADMIN` status-only loan decision endpoints with locked loan request reads, `reviewed_by`, `reviewed_at`, and admin audit logs without wallet credit, disbursement, transaction records, ledger entries, idempotency records, repayment, or installments.
- Step 26 Send Money receiver validation: added authenticated receiver resolve API for registered mobile number or SmartKash QR payload, validating active sender, registered active receiver, self-transfer block, and active receiver wallet without wallet transfer, PIN verification, idempotency, transaction records, or ledger entries.
- Step 27 Send Money transfer flow: added authenticated money-changing `POST /api/send-money` with mobile/QR receiver selection, PIN confirmation, idempotency, locked sender/receiver wallets, balance debit/credit, sender/receiver transaction records, and linked immutable ledger entries.
- Step 28 Merchant Payment transfer flow: added authenticated money-changing `POST /api/payments/merchant` with merchant number lookup, PIN confirmation, idempotency, locked customer/merchant wallets, customer debit, merchant credit, merchant payment transaction records, linked immutable ledger entries, and admin payments read support.
- Step 29 Savings Deposit transfer flow: added authenticated money-changing `POST /api/savings/goals/{id}/deposit` with PIN confirmation, idempotency, locked savings goal and wallet, wallet debit, goal current amount update, auto-complete when target is reached, `SAVINGS_DEPOSIT` transaction record, and immutable debit ledger entry.
- Step 30 Mobile Recharge wallet debit flow: updated demo `POST /api/recharge` to require PIN and idempotency, lock and debit the user wallet, create a `MOBILE_RECHARGE` transaction record, create an immutable debit ledger entry, attach the transaction reference to the recharge record, and keep the zero-budget no-provider demo success rule.
- Step 31 FCM transaction alert foundation: added `firebase_devices` migration, authenticated FCM token registration API, notification device entity/repository/DTO/mapper/service, FCM properties, and transaction alert service boundary that skips safely when FCM is disabled or Firebase Admin is not configured.
- Step 32 Transaction alert wiring: connected `TransactionAlertService` to Add Money decisions, Loan decisions, Send Money, Merchant Payment, Savings Deposit, and Mobile Recharge success paths while keeping FCM delivery optional and non-blocking.
- Step 33 API error response polish: added consistent JSON error handling for missing/invalid JWT, forbidden admin access, validation errors, duplicate/constraint conflicts, missing resources, and safe unexpected server errors.
- Step 34 local E2E seed and API verification guide: added a dev-only PostgreSQL seed script for demo users/profiles/wallets and at least 15 rows in each main business table, plus a manual backend E2E API test guide with expected outputs.
- Step 35 Flutter API client foundation: added Dio, secure token storage, centralized API client/providers, backend auth repository, backend token model, configurable API base URL, and Flutter-side API error mapping without adding UI screens or feature flows.
- Step 36 Flutter auth flow foundation: added auth session state/status, Riverpod auth controller, Firebase current-user backend JWT sync, and local sign-out coordination without adding login/OTP UI or visual screen design.
- Step 37 Flutter reference UI shell: recorded the user's reference-image UI rule and added SmartKash-original Home and Login UI shells inspired by the provided layout/hierarchy while using different branding and colors.
- Step 37b Flutter UI run fix: cleaned analyzer-blocking UI shell warnings by removing an unused import, replacing deprecated opacity calls, and fixing const lint issues so Flutter analysis passes again.
- Step 38 Flutter generated brand assets: generated original SmartKash logo/header/promo images, registered Flutter assets, and wired them into Home and Login UI without copying reference-brand artwork.
- Step 38b Flutter launcher and web icon polish: replaced default Android launcher and web favicon/PWA icons with the generated SmartKash logo mark and aligned web theme colors.
- Step 39 Firebase OTP login UI: wired Login screen to Firebase Phone Auth test OTP, Firebase sign-in, backend JWT sync, loading/info/error states, and Android Google Services config support without adding PIN or wallet feature UI.
- Step 40 Flutter auth route guard and logged-in Home state: made routing depend on backend-authenticated session state, restored Firebase/backend session on startup, redirected unauthenticated users to Login, and showed logged-in phone/role plus sign-out on Home without adding feature API screens.
- Step 41 PIN setup UI flow: exposed safe `pinSet` metadata in `GET /api/users/me`, added Flutter PIN setup API/repository/controller state, added a SmartKash PIN setup screen, and routed authenticated users with missing PIN to setup before Home without storing PIN in Flutter.
- Step 42 backend local env import: configured Spring Boot to import ignored `services/backend/.env` during local runs, normalized Firebase private key formatting, completed Firebase service account JSON fields, and verified Firebase Admin initialization without committing secrets.
- Step 43 Firebase Android package alignment: aligned Android `namespace`, `applicationId`, and `MainActivity` package with the provided Firebase Android client config package `com.smartkash.app`.
- Step 44 Firebase OTP error handling fix: wrapped Firebase phone verification failures in an app-safe exception and mapped them to clear user-facing messages instead of leaking platform TypeError text.
- Step 45 Firebase OTP platform guard: blocked unsupported Chrome/Web OTP attempts with a clear message because the current Firebase client setup is Android-only.
- Step 46 backend env import hardening: made Spring Boot import the ignored backend `.env` both when run from `services/backend` and when run from the repository root/IDE.

## Important Architecture Decisions

- Flutter full cross-platform app.
- Supported Flutter platforms: Android, iOS, Web, Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- Android remains the primary local testing target on Windows.
- Web can also be tested locally on Windows.
- Windows desktop builds require Visual Studio Desktop development with C++ workload.
- iOS/macOS builds require macOS with Xcode.
- Linux builds require a Linux environment.
- Flutter architecture: Riverpod + feature-first folders.
- Spring Boot backend root package: `com.smartkash`.
- Backend architecture: clean layered feature modules with controller, service, service implementation, repository, entity, DTO, mapper, enums, exception, config, security, firebase, notification, util, and audit.
- Main business database: PostgreSQL.
- Migration tool: Flyway.
- Firebase usage: Phone Auth test OTP and important FCM alerts only.
- Firebase Phone Auth uses test phone numbers and fixed OTP only in MVP; real SMS OTP is not used.
- Flutter Firebase initialization is opt-in until local Firebase Android client config is provided.
- Spring Boot Firebase Admin config uses environment variables only; service account JSON must not be committed.
- Spring Boot verifies Firebase ID tokens before issuing a backend JWT.
- Backend JWT is stateless and contains minimal claims from the persisted user record: Firebase UID, mobile number, and role.
- Minimal persisted user foundation uses `users.firebase_uid` and `users.mobile_number` as unique identifiers.
- Minimal persisted role/status values use `UserRole` and `UserStatus` enums.
- `GET /api/users/me` is read-only and returns the current persisted user/profile record when it exists.
- Firebase login creates or finds the minimal persisted user record and ensures one zero-balance wallet exists, but does not create PIN, ledger, transaction, idempotency, or money-changing records.
- Firebase login now also ensures one zero-balance wallet exists for the authenticated user, but does not create ledger, transaction, idempotency, or money-changing records.
- `PUT /api/users/me/profile` creates or updates only the authenticated user's minimal profile fields and resolves ownership from JWT/Firebase UID.
- `POST /api/auth/set-pin` requires backend JWT, resolves the user from Firebase UID, validates a 5-digit numeric PIN, stores only a BCrypt hash, and returns only PIN setup metadata.
- `POST /api/auth/verify-pin` requires backend JWT, checks the raw request PIN against the stored BCrypt hash, tracks failed attempts, and blocks PIN verification for 15 minutes after 5 wrong attempts.
- Before Flutter UI design work starts, Codex must ask the user for sample/reference images and use them as the visual direction.
- Send Money must support both registered mobile number and QR receiver selection.
- Wallet balance is stored for fast reads, backed by immutable ledger entries.
- Step 12 wallet foundation creates the wallet table/read model only; balance mutation is intentionally blocked until ledger and transaction foundations exist.
- Step 13 ledger/transaction foundation adds persistence only; services must later create transaction records and immutable ledger entries together in one database transaction when money movement is implemented.
- Step 14 idempotency foundation stores one key per user plus request hash, operation type, status, optional saved response body, and expiry time so future money-changing APIs can safely handle retries.
- Step 15 wallet lifecycle creates only the initial wallet record with zero balance and `ACTIVE` status; future balance changes still require ledger entries and transaction records.
- Step 16 admin audit foundation records future admin state changes with action, target type, target id, details, and admin user reference.
- Step 17 Add Money request foundation allows authenticated customers to create/list pending funding requests, but the request itself is not a wallet balance change.
- Step 18 merchant profile foundation keeps merchant business data in `merchants` and role in `users.role = MERCHANT`, matching the planned merchant model.
- Step 19 Loan request foundation follows MVP Phase 1 scope: approval/rejection will only update status later; disbursement and repayment remain future scope.
- Step 20 Mobile recharge foundation follows the zero-budget MVP rule: recharge creates a demo record only and does not call a real recharge provider or change wallet balance.
- Step 21 Savings goal foundation creates savings targets only. Depositing money into savings remains a future money-changing step that must use PIN, idempotency, wallet locking, transactions, and immutable ledger entries.
- Step 22 Transaction history API is read-only and user-scoped. It can return empty lists until future money-changing flows create transaction records.
- Step 23 Admin read API foundation protects `/admin/**` with `ROLE_ADMIN` and keeps the admin panel minimal and read-only until dedicated approval/rejection steps are implemented.
- Step 24 Add Money approval is the first backend money-changing flow. It uses admin role protection, idempotency, request/wallet locking, wallet credit, transaction record, immutable ledger entry, and audit log in one database transaction.
- Step 25 Loan approval follows MVP Phase 1 scope and is intentionally status-only with audit logging; future loan disbursement must be a separate money-changing flow.
- Step 26 Send Money receiver validation supports both registered mobile number and QR receiver selection. The MVP QR payload format is `SMARTKASH_USER:<mobile-number>`, and it must resolve to an active registered receiver with an active wallet before future transfer processing.
- Step 27 Send Money transfer is the first customer wallet-to-wallet money-changing flow. It uses PIN verification, idempotency, pessimistic wallet locking, balance debit/credit, sender `SEND_MONEY` transaction, receiver `RECEIVE_MONEY` transaction, and linked debit/credit ledger entries.
- Step 28 Merchant Payment uses the same money-changing safety model as Send Money, but resolves the receiving account through `merchants.merchant_number` and credits the merchant user's wallet.
- Step 29 Savings Deposit uses the money-changing safety model for a one-sided wallet debit into a savings goal balance. The wallet ledger records the debit, while the savings goal tracks the saved amount.
- Step 30 Mobile Recharge uses the money-changing safety model for a demo provider-less wallet debit. The recharge record is marked `SUCCESS` locally and references the wallet debit transaction.
- Step 31 keeps notifications limited to important transaction alerts. Device tokens are persisted in PostgreSQL, and FCM sending is isolated in `TransactionAlertService` so controllers and business services do not contain Firebase Messaging details.
- Step 32 keeps notification delivery out of controllers and uses the `TransactionAlertService` boundary from business services after successful state changes.
- Step 33 standardizes backend error responses with `ApiErrorResponse` so Flutter can handle authentication, authorization, validation, conflict, not-found, and unexpected errors through one response shape.
- Step 34 keeps E2E seed data outside Flyway migrations. Local demo data is loaded manually through `scripts/dev/seed-e2e-data.sql` and must not be treated as production data.
- Step 35 centralizes Flutter backend communication through `ApiClient`, maps backend `ApiErrorResponse` into `ApiException`, and stores only backend JWT values in secure storage.
- Step 36 separates auth orchestration from UI: Firebase Auth remains in `FirebasePhoneAuthService`, backend JWT exchange remains in `BackendAuthRepository`, and `AuthController` coordinates state for future screens.
- Step 37 establishes the UI reference rule: use provided screenshots for layout direction only, keep SmartKash branding/colors original, and ask for more screen-specific references or asset dimensions before future visual screen work when needed.
- Step 37b keeps the UI shell presentation-only while making analyzer output clean enough for local Flutter run/build verification.
- Step 38 uses generated raster assets for visual polish while keeping paths centralized in `AppAssets`; final production icons can later be optimized/resized or replaced with vector/adaptive-icon assets.
- Step 38b uses the generated SmartKash mark for Android launcher and web PWA icons so the installed app/browser tab no longer uses Flutter default branding.
- Step 39 keeps Firebase Phone Auth logic in `FirebasePhoneAuthService`, backend JWT exchange in `BackendAuthRepository`, session orchestration in `AuthController`, and UI rendering in `LoginScreen`.
- Step 40 keeps route decisions in a Riverpod-backed `GoRouter` provider. Home is reachable only after `AuthSessionStatus.authenticated`, and app startup tries to restore an existing Firebase session before syncing backend JWT.
- Step 41 exposes only PIN metadata (`pinSet`, `pinUpdatedAt`) to Flutter. Raw PIN and PIN hash remain backend-only. Flutter sends PIN only when saving setup through `POST /api/auth/set-pin`.
- Step 42 uses Spring Boot config import `optional:file:.env[.properties]` from the backend working directory. The `.env` file remains ignored by Git and must not be committed. Firebase private key formatting is normalized before Google credential parsing.
- Step 43 uses Android application ID `com.smartkash.app` because the provided Firebase Android client config contains package name `com.smartkash.app`.
- Step 44 keeps Firebase platform exceptions out of UI state by converting phone auth failures into a small local `FirebasePhoneAuthException` model before the controller builds user-facing copy.
- Step 45 confirms Firebase OTP is currently Android-only until a Firebase Web app config is added for Chrome/Web.
- Step 46 imports both `optional:file:.env[.properties]` and `optional:file:services/backend/.env[.properties]` so Firebase Admin env values are found from CLI and IDE run modes.
- Money-changing operations require transactions, safe wallet locking, idempotency keys, and audit logs.
- Codex uses a manual verification workflow by default: do focused changes, update learning/progress docs, run lightweight checks only, commit/push, and provide manual verification commands.

- Step 46 changes only Spring config import paths; it does not commit `.env`, Firebase Admin JSON, local machine secrets, or change authentication rules.
- `flutter create` timed out in the sandbox, so the minimal Flutter skeleton was created manually and verified with Flutter tooling.
- Global `mvn` is not available in the Codex session, so backend verification should use Maven Wrapper `.\mvnw.cmd`.
- Flyway works against local PostgreSQL 17.10 after adding `flyway-database-postgresql`, but logs a warning that this Flyway version officially tested support up to PostgreSQL 16.
- Android debug APK builds successfully after using Flutter v2 embedding metadata, AGP `8.6.0`, and installed NDK `28.2.13676358`; Flutter warns these AGP/Kotlin versions should be upgraded in a future maintenance step.
- Heavy verification commands are now user-run by default unless explicitly requested, to reduce token and execution limit usage.

## Next Recommended Step

- Restart backend after Step 46, verify `/actuator/health`, then run Android Firebase OTP login again.
