# SmartKash Backend API Plan

## Client Platform Scope

The Spring Boot backend serves the SmartKash Flutter full cross-platform app. Supported Flutter clients are Android, iOS, Web, Windows, Linux, and macOS. API contracts must stay platform-neutral so the same backend can support every Flutter target.

## Backend Technology Stack

- Spring Boot
- Spring Web
- Spring Security
- Spring Data JPA
- Hibernate
- PostgreSQL Driver
- Lombok
- Bean Validation
- Firebase Admin SDK
- JWT library
- Flyway for database migration
- Spring Boot Actuator for health checks
- OpenAPI/Swagger for API documentation

## Backend Package Architecture

Root package: `com.smartkash`.

Feature modules:

- `com.smartkash.auth`
- `com.smartkash.user`
- `com.smartkash.wallet`
- `com.smartkash.ledger`
- `com.smartkash.transaction`
- `com.smartkash.idempotency`
- `com.smartkash.addmoney`
- `com.smartkash.sendmoney`
- `com.smartkash.payment`
- `com.smartkash.savings`
- `com.smartkash.loan`
- `com.smartkash.recharge`
- `com.smartkash.merchant`
- `com.smartkash.notification`
- `com.smartkash.admin`
- `com.smartkash.common`
- `com.smartkash.config`
- `com.smartkash.security`

Each feature module should use this internal structure when needed:

- `controller`
- `service`
- `service.impl`
- `repository`
- `entity`
- `dto.request`
- `dto.response`
- `mapper`
- `enums`

Example:

```text
com.smartkash.wallet.controller
com.smartkash.wallet.service
com.smartkash.wallet.service.impl
com.smartkash.wallet.repository
com.smartkash.wallet.entity
com.smartkash.wallet.dto.request
com.smartkash.wallet.dto.response
com.smartkash.wallet.mapper
com.smartkash.wallet.enums
```

## Backend Coding Rules

- Controllers must be thin.
- Business logic must stay in the service layer.
- Use service interfaces and implementation classes for major modules.
- Repositories should only handle database access.
- Entities must not be exposed directly in API responses.
- DTOs must be used for request and response payloads.
- Mappers should convert between Entity and DTO.
- Enums should be used for fixed statuses and types.
- Use Bean Validation annotations for input validation.
- Use global exception handling.
- Use database transactions for money-changing operations.
- Use optimistic locking or another safe locking strategy for wallet balance updates.
- Use idempotency keys for money-changing APIs.
- Use audit logs for admin actions and critical money operations.
- Do not hardcode secrets.
- Do not store raw PIN.
- Do not update or delete immutable ledger entries.
- Use reversal ledger entries for corrections.

## Important Backend Enums

- `UserRole`: `CUSTOMER`, `MERCHANT`, `ADMIN`
- `UserStatus`: `ACTIVE`, `BLOCKED`, `PENDING`
- `WalletStatus`: `ACTIVE`, `BLOCKED`
- `TransactionType`: `ADD_MONEY`, `SEND_MONEY`, `RECEIVE_MONEY`, `MERCHANT_PAYMENT`, `SAVINGS_DEPOSIT`, `MOBILE_RECHARGE`, `LOAN_REQUEST`
- `TransactionStatus`: `PENDING`, `SUCCESS`, `FAILED`, `REJECTED`, `CANCELLED`
- `LedgerEntryType`: `DEBIT`, `CREDIT`, `REVERSAL`
- `AddMoneyStatus`: `PENDING`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`
- `LoanStatus`: `PENDING`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`
- `RechargeStatus`: `SUCCESS`, `FAILED`
- `MerchantStatus`: `ACTIVE`, `INACTIVE`, `BLOCKED`
- `NotificationType`: `ADD_MONEY`, `SEND_MONEY`, `PAYMENT`, `RECHARGE`, `SAVINGS`, `LOAN`

## Auth APIs

- `POST /api/auth/firebase-login`: verify Firebase token and issue backend JWT.
- `POST /api/auth/set-pin`: set hashed PIN for authenticated user.
- PIN setup requires authenticated backend JWT, accepts `pin` and `confirmPin`, validates exactly 5 numeric digits, hashes the PIN with BCrypt, and never returns the raw PIN.
- `POST /api/auth/verify-pin`: verify PIN in backend only.
- PIN verification requires authenticated backend JWT, validates a 5-digit PIN, compares it with BCrypt, tracks failed attempts, and temporarily blocks verification after 5 wrong attempts for 15 minutes.
- `POST /api/devices/fcm-token`: save/update FCM device token.
- Step 31 implements authenticated `POST /api/devices/fcm-token` to save or refresh the current user's FCM token and device type. Notification sending remains dedicated to the backend notification module and respects `FCM_ENABLED`.
- Step 32 wires important transaction alerts into successful Add Money decisions, Loan decisions, Send Money, Merchant Payment, Savings Deposit, and Mobile Recharge flows. The API response does not depend on FCM delivery success.

## User APIs

- `GET /api/users/me`: read the authenticated user's persisted user/profile foundation record.
- `PUT /api/users/me/profile`: create or update the authenticated user's minimal profile fields: `fullName`, `email`, and `avatarUrl`.
- Profile update resolves the user from the authenticated backend JWT/Firebase UID and never accepts a user ID in the request body.
- Firebase login now creates or finds the minimal persisted `users` record by Firebase UID, using the Firebase phone number as the unique SmartKash mobile number.
- New Firebase-linked users start as `CUSTOMER` and `ACTIVE` until later profile, PIN, merchant, or admin management steps update them.
- Firebase login creates or finds the user's zero-balance wallet lifecycle record.
- Firebase login does not create PINs, transactions, ledgers, idempotency records, or money-changing records.

## Wallet APIs

- `GET /api/wallet/me`: get current user's wallet balance.
- Step 12 wallet foundation exposes wallet read only. It does not create wallets automatically, mutate balances, create ledger entries, or create transaction records.
- Step 15 links wallet lifecycle to Firebase login so each authenticated user has one zero-balance `BDT` wallet. This is not a money movement and does not create ledger entries or transaction records.

## Add Money APIs

- `POST /api/add-money/requests`: create Add Money request.
- `GET /api/add-money/requests`: list current user's Add Money requests.
- Step 17 implements customer Add Money request create/list foundation only. New requests are saved as `PENDING`; no admin approval, wallet credit, ledger entry, transaction record, idempotency record, or FCM alert is created yet.

## Send Money APIs

- `POST /api/send-money/resolve-receiver`: resolve and validate a receiver by registered mobile number or SmartKash QR payload before transfer.
- `POST /api/send-money`: send money using registered mobile number or QR payload.
- Required validation: authenticated user, PIN, receiver, account status, sender balance, idempotency key.
- Successful wallet-to-wallet transfer must create linked debit and credit ledger entries under one transaction reference.
- Step 26 implements receiver validation only. It accepts either `mobileNumber` or QR payload format `SMARTKASH_USER:<mobile-number>`, resolves the receiver from registered backend users, checks sender/receiver account status, prevents self-transfer, and checks receiver wallet status. It does not debit wallets, credit wallets, verify PIN, create transaction records, create ledger entries, or use idempotency yet.
- Step 27 implements `POST /api/send-money` wallet-to-wallet transfer. It accepts either `mobileNumber` or QR payload, validates authenticated active sender, receiver, PIN, idempotency key, active sender/receiver wallets, and sufficient sender balance. A successful transfer debits sender wallet, credits receiver wallet, creates sender `SEND_MONEY` and receiver `RECEIVE_MONEY` transaction records, creates linked `DEBIT` and `CREDIT` ledger entries under the sender transfer reference, and completes the idempotency key.

## Payment APIs

- `POST /api/payments/merchant`: pay merchant by merchant number/account number.
- Merchant payment debits customer wallet and credits merchant wallet.
- Step 18 adds merchant profile foundation with `POST /api/merchants/me` and `GET /api/merchants/me`. Merchant payment is still future scope and no wallet debit/credit is implemented yet.
- Step 28 implements `POST /api/payments/merchant`. It validates authenticated active customer, active merchant profile, active merchant user, PIN, idempotency key, active customer/merchant wallets, and sufficient customer balance. A successful payment debits the customer wallet, credits the merchant wallet, creates `MERCHANT_PAYMENT` transaction records for customer and merchant, creates linked debit/credit ledger entries under the customer payment reference, and completes the idempotency key.

## Transaction APIs

- `GET /api/transactions`: list user transactions with date/type/status filters.
- `GET /api/transactions/{id}`: get receipt/details for one transaction.
- Step 13 creates transaction and ledger persistence foundation only. It does not expose transaction APIs yet and does not create money movement records.
- Step 22 implements read-only transaction history APIs. The list endpoint supports optional `type`, `status`, `from`, and `to` query parameters and returns only the authenticated user's transaction records. It does not create, update, or delete transactions and does not create ledger entries or wallet balance changes.

## Savings APIs

- `POST /api/savings/goals`: create savings goal.
- `GET /api/savings/goals`: list savings goals.
- `POST /api/savings/goals/{id}/deposit`: deposit from wallet to savings goal.
- Step 21 implements savings goal create/list foundation only. New goals start as `ACTIVE` with `currentAmount = 0.00`; no wallet debit, savings deposit, ledger entry, transaction record, idempotency record, PIN confirmation, or FCM alert is created yet.
- Savings deposit remains future scope and must follow full money-changing API rules.
- Step 29 implements `POST /api/savings/goals/{id}/deposit`. It validates authenticated active user, active savings goal ownership, PIN, idempotency key, active wallet, and sufficient wallet balance. A successful deposit debits the wallet, increases the goal current amount, marks the goal `COMPLETED` when the target amount is reached, creates a `SAVINGS_DEPOSIT` transaction record, creates an immutable debit ledger entry, and completes the idempotency key.

## Loan APIs

- `POST /api/loans/requests`: create loan request.
- `GET /api/loans/requests`: list current user's loan requests.
- Step 19 implements customer Loan request create/list foundation only. New requests are saved as `PENDING`; no admin approval/rejection, wallet disbursement, repayment, installment tracking, ledger entry, transaction record, idempotency record, or notification is created yet.

## Recharge APIs

- `POST /api/recharge`: create demo mobile recharge.
- `GET /api/recharge`: list current user's mobile recharge records.
- Step 20 implements demo mobile recharge create/list foundation only. New demo records are saved as `SUCCESS` for learning/demo flow, but no wallet debit, real provider call, ledger entry, transaction record, idempotency record, PIN confirmation, or FCM alert is created yet.
- A later real wallet-debit recharge step must require authenticated user, PIN confirmation, idempotency key, active wallet, sufficient balance, transaction record, immutable ledger entry, and provider/demo-provider status handling.
- Step 30 implements wallet-debit demo Mobile Recharge. `POST /api/recharge` now requires PIN and idempotency key, debits the authenticated user's wallet, creates a `MOBILE_RECHARGE` transaction record, creates an immutable debit ledger entry, saves the demo recharge record as `SUCCESS`, and completes the idempotency key. It still does not call any real recharge provider.

## Minimal Admin APIs

All admin routes require authenticated `ADMIN` role.

- `GET /admin/users`
- `GET /admin/transactions`
- `GET /admin/add-money/requests`
- `POST /admin/add-money/requests/{id}/approve`
- `POST /admin/add-money/requests/{id}/reject`
- `GET /admin/loans/requests`
- `POST /admin/loans/requests/{id}/approve`
- `POST /admin/loans/requests/{id}/reject`
- `GET /admin/recharges`
- `GET /admin/payments`
- `GET /admin/audit-logs`

Step 16 adds admin audit log persistence foundation only. It does not implement `GET /admin/audit-logs` or wire audit logging into admin approval/rejection APIs yet.

Step 23 implements the minimal read-only admin API foundation for `GET /admin/users`, `GET /admin/transactions`, `GET /admin/add-money/requests`, `GET /admin/loans/requests`, `GET /admin/recharges`, `GET /admin/payments`, and `GET /admin/audit-logs`. All `/admin/**` routes require authenticated `ADMIN` role. Step 23 does not implement approval, rejection, analytics, settings, dashboards, complex role management, wallet mutation, or money-changing admin actions.

Step 28 updates `GET /admin/payments` to return `MERCHANT_PAYMENT` transaction records after merchant payment persistence exists.

Step 24 implements Add Money admin approval/rejection. Approval requires `ADMIN` role and an idempotency key, locks the Add Money request and customer wallet, changes the request to `APPROVED`, credits the customer wallet, creates a user-facing `ADD_MONEY` transaction record, creates an immutable `CREDIT` ledger entry, stores idempotency completion, and records an admin audit log in one database transaction. Rejection changes only the request status to `REJECTED`, stores idempotency completion, and records an audit log; it does not change wallet balance or create ledger/transaction records.

Step 25 implements Loan admin approval/rejection status-only flow. Approval or rejection requires `ADMIN` role, locks the loan request, updates `status`, `reviewed_by`, and `reviewed_at`, and records an admin audit log. It does not disburse money, credit wallets, create transactions, create ledger entries, create idempotency records, or manage repayments/installments.

## Idempotency Rule

All money-changing APIs must accept a unique `clientRequestId` or `idempotencyKey`. If the same key is submitted again for the same request type and user, the backend must not create duplicate ledger entries, transaction records, or wallet changes.

Step 14 adds the `idempotency_keys` persistence foundation and internal service helper only. It does not expose idempotency through a public API and does not wire idempotency into money-changing flows yet.

Applies to:

- Send Money
- Merchant Payment
- Add Money approval
- Savings deposit
- Mobile Recharge
- Future Loan wallet credit if added later
